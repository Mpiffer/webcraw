The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Python**: The web scraper is built using Python, specifically the Scrapy library. This is a shared dependency for the files "main.py", "reddit_spider.py", "items.py", "pipelines.py", "middlewares.py", and "settings.py".

2. **Scrapy**: This is a Python library used for web scraping. It is a shared dependency for the files "main.py", "reddit_spider.py", "items.py", "pipelines.py", "middlewares.py", and "settings.py".

3. **HTML and CSS**: These are used to build the personal website. They are shared dependencies for the files "index.html" and "styles.css".

4. **Tailwind CSS**: This is a utility-first CSS framework used for styling the personal website. It is a shared dependency for the files "index.html" and "styles.css".

5. **JSON**: This is the format in which the scraped data from Reddit is stored. It is a shared dependency for the files "main.py", "reddit_spider.py", "items.py", "pipelines.py", "middlewares.py", and "settings.py".

6. **DOM Elements**: The JavaScript file "main.js" will interact with the DOM elements defined in "index.html". The id names of these elements are shared dependencies between these two files.

7. **README.md**: This file will contain instructions on how to execute the code in the other files. It is a shared dependency with all other files as it needs to accurately reflect their contents and usage.

Note: The specific names of exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names would depend on the specific implementation of the personal website and web scraper.
